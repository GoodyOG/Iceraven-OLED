# Iceraven-OLED
This applies amoled dark mode to,the Iceraven app since Firefox and all it's forks for android doesn't have it. Inspiration is gotten from https://github.com/ArtikusHG/Mull-OLEDDark who did same thing to Mull browser (privacy based firefox). I did this for iceraven as it's more customizable.

I'm working on a way to automatically patch latest build from the iceraven official repo, just like Mull-OLEDDark does.
