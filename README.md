# Iceraven-OLED
This applies amoled dark mode to the Iceraven app since Firefox and all it's forks for android doesn't have it. Inspiration is gotten from https://github.com/ArtikusHG/Mull-OLEDDark who did same thing to Mull browser (privacy based firefox). I did this for iceraven as it's more customizable.

It now automatically build and releases when there is a new update from 
https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser
