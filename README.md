# Iceraven-OLED  

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/arch-arm64_v8a-<COLOR>.svg)](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser)  

This project applies an AMOLED dark mode theme to the **arm64-v8a** version of [Iceraven Browser](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser), addressing the lack of native OLED-friendly dark mode support in Firefox and its Android forks. Inspired by [Ironfox-OLEDDark](https://github.com/ArtikusHG/Ironfox-OLEDDark) (a similar modification for IronFox Browser, a privacy-focused Firefox fork formerly known as Mull), this repository focuses on enhancing Iceraven due to its superior customization capabilities.

### Features  
- Automatically builds and releases updated APKs when upstream updates occur in [fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser)  
- OLED-optimized dark theme for reduced battery consumption  
- Enhanced visual comfort in low-light environments  

### Why Iceraven?  
While many Firefox-based browsers exist, Iceraven stands out with its:
- Extensive customization options  
- Active maintenance via [fork-maintainers](https://github.com/fork-maintainers)  
- User-driven feature implementation

*Note: Requires Android device with ARM64-v8a architecture.*
